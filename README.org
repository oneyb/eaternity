  This repository contains the code (Ipython notebooks, mostly) of LCA-related
  analyses that I do for eaternity.  That is, the main purpose is to keep my
  python scripts running [[https://docs.brightwaylca.org/][Brightway2]] here.

  Below is a handy function for working in Brightway2 in a virtual environment
  (see [[file:eaternity-brightway-functions.bash][some =bash= functions]]):

#+begin_src shell
get-bash-functions-for-bw2
io-bw2
#+end_src

All the code contained here is crap, but I need to stay organized.  I don't
mind if you inspect my crap.  Maybe my crap is helpful :).
