* eaternity climate-friendly menus - [[http://eaternity.org]]

  This contains the scripts for LCA analyses that I do for eaternity.  That
  is, the main purpose is to keep my python scripts running [[https://docs.brightwaylca.org/][Brightway2]] here.

Below is a handy function for working in Brightway2 in a virtual environment
(see [[file:.install-brightway.sh][install script]])
#+begin_src bash

function turn-on-bw2-virtualenv ()
{
    dir=/d/documents/eaternity/bw2
    if [ -z "$_OLD_VIRTUAL_PATH" ]; then
        echo activating
        source $dir/bin/activate
    else
        echo deactivating
        deactivate
    fi
}

#+end_src
